# 💻 Fivetran Hands-on Lab: Laptop Requirements

To ensure a smooth and successful hands-on lab experience, please make sure your laptop meets the following requirements:

-----

## Python Environment 🐍

You will need to have **Python version 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12** installed and verified on your system. The instructor will be using **Python 3.12.8**.

While detailed installation instructions are beyond the scope of this document, here are some common approaches for managing Python versions:

  * **Multiple Python Versions:** For managing multiple Python versions (e.g., if you have other projects requiring different versions), consider tools like `pyenv` for macOS or the **Python Launcher** for Windows.
  * **Universal Installer:** You can always download a universal installer for your desired Python version directly from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

**Verification:** To verify your Python installation, open your terminal or command prompt and enter:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see an output indicating your installed Python version (e.g., `Python 3.12.8`).

**Virtual Environments:** You will also need to understand how to create, activate, and deactivate Python virtual environments, which are crucial for managing project dependencies.

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 📝

You'll need an IDE or code editor to develop your Fivetran Connector. Here are some popular options:

  * **[Visual Studio Code (free)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)** (highly recommended)
  * **[PyCharm Community Edition (free)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/other.html)**
  * **[Cursor Hobby Plan (limited free)](https://cursor.com/pricing)**
  * A simple text editor (e.g., Mac TextEdit, Windows Notepad)

-----

## Database Query Tool 📊

A database query tool capable of opening a **DuckDB file** is required. A recommended option is:

  * **[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/)** (Note that the first time you try to open a DuckDB file, you will be prompted to download the plugin.)

-----

## Access to a Large Language Model (LLM) 🧠

### 🔥🔥🔥 ATTENDEES WILL NOT BE CODING THIS BY HAND/MANUALLY (YAY)\! 🔥🔥🔥

You **must** have access to a Large Language Model to assist with the coding tasks during the lab. These models will significantly streamline the development process. (And don't worry about learning how to prompt for the best code output. We will have some basic prompts ready to go the day of the lab.) Recommended LLMs include:

  * **Gemini** (instructor tested)
  * **Claude** (instructor tested)
  * **ChatGPT** (instructor tested)
  * **Llama**
  * **DeepSeek**
-----

## Folder Structure for Code 📁

  * Create a folder for the lab code.
  * Ensure the code folder does NOT have spaces in the path (coding best practice).
  * Ensure the code folder does NOT reside under a system folder such as "My Documents" for Windows or "Documents" for macOS.
